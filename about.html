						<h6 class="job-title">Mechanical Engineering Intern</h6>
						<h6 class="job-date">May 2021 - Aug 2021</h6>
						<p class="job-description">Matician is focused on building autonomous robots for consumer use at home, and I worked on pre-production prototypes to try to finalize the company's first robot for manufacturing. I took ownership on 5 different projects, focused on improving the functionality, reliability, and manufacturability of the robot. This included overhauling designs, integrating new sensors, and making the robot more reliable by life cycle testing components. I was also responsible for the first couple parts transitioning from 3D printing to injection molding. I talked to suppliers directly, ran mold simulations, made drawings, and went through many design iterations.</p>

					<p class="text-box">Hey! &#128075;</p>
					<p class="text-box">I am an engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I study mechatronics engineering and am interested in many different disciplines. This summer I am working at <a href="https://matician.com/">Matician</a> as a mechanical engineering intern, working on smart robots for everyday tasks. In university, some of my favourite courses to study are related to materials, mechanics, and physics.</p>
					<div class="text-box">

						<p>When I'm not working or studying, I like to spend my time designing, inventing, and exploring. Recently I wrapped up my custom cycloidal actuator project, a compact, powerful, and versatile actuator designed for robotic applications. Previous to that project I teamed up with my peers to build an easy to manufacture ventilator, to help with the demand during the COVID-19 pandemic. We created a simple, hygienic and cheap solution to the <a href="https://www.mghfoundation.com/en/news/code-life-ventilator-challenge/">Code Life Ventilator Challenge</a>, myself taking a bulk of the mechanical design work.</p>

						<p>Friends and family wonâ€™t hesitate to tell you that I will never stop creating new things, I have a deep passion for making, tinkering, and experimenting with new ideas. Whether it be designing new things to be 3D printed, or milled on my new CNC router, it always brings me joy to see something from my mind come to fruition. There is something innately fascinating to me about making.</p>
					</div>
					<p class="text-box">Aside from engineering and projects, I love to explore new places. From travelling, camping, hiking, or even just adventuring around the city, experiencing new things is thrilling for me (I also love trying new food!). I am an avid camper, sailor, and love doing most board sports.</p>
