									<p>While working on other mechanical projects over my life, I always ran into one big problem: manufacturing. Paying a job shop to do a one-off part for me is way too expensive, and only so much can be made at home with basic tools. This problem was partly solved when I built a 3D printer in 2013, but there was still a missing piece; the ability to manufacture metal parts. Sometimes 3D printed plastic is just not good enough and stiffer, stronger materials need to be used. This, along with the challenge of 3 axis machine design enticed me enough to start this project in January of 2020.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<img class="center-picture" src="../assets/CNC CAD.png" style="height: auto; margin-bottom: 1em;">
									<p>The entire design revolves around a T slot extrusion bed that ensures that the Y-axis rails are parallel and that the gantry structure is reinforced. Because of my manufacturing constraints, most of the parts had to be extrusion or 3D printed, but most of the 3D printed parts were designed to be converted to routered parts down the road. A cool learning experience for me was using topology optimization for a bracket between two pieces of extrusion, while not very practical it did offer me insight into FEA optimization. The entire cost of the machine was kept under $700 by avoiding the use of linear rails and ball screws, which typically push the price of the machine over $2000. Instead, a bearing block style system was used in conjunction with steel reinforced belts. For my purposes, it was an easy and cheap solution that still offers more than enough strength.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<img class="center-picture" src="../assets/CNC Build.png" style="height: auto; margin-bottom: 1em;">
									<p>The build process was very long, spanning 2 months from April to May, mainly because I wanted to ensure that it was built properly and robustly. The main base is a wood table that I filled with a sand epoxy mixture for dampening and rigidity, everything else is built up from there. Throughout the entire process, I ensured perpendicularity was as close to perfect as possible, and that all dimensions were accurate to reduce tolerance stacks. Something very important I learned while building is just how important wire management is, originally I planned on just using cable sleeves but I realized how easily something could break without proper routing. I settled for a durable drag chain system on the X and Y axes and making everything unpluggable to make troubleshooting much easier.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<img class="right-picture" src="../assets/Dial Indicator On Rail.png" style="height: calc(12 * 1.5625em);">
									<p>The CNC router is still being improved and developed but as of now, it can cut wood, plastics, and aluminum with up to 0.002in accuracy. The T slot table makes work holding super easy with custom clamps or even a machine vice. The router, despite being for wood, is very powerful and can spin at over 30k rpm. In the future, I would like to try more 3D contours and hopefully some PCB milling with extremely small end mills.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<img class="left-picture" src="../assets/CNC Electronics.png" style="height: calc(12 * 1.5625em);">
									<p>The machine is controlled with a 32 bit ARM processor and an ESP32 module for wifi connectivity and controlling the TFT touchscreen. The processor sends commands to 3 TB6600 stepper controllers that in turn control the NEMA 23 stepper motors on all axes. The ESP32 communicates with the STM32 via serial and can send G-code to jog it, change a tool, probe a tool, and run a program from wifi or an SD card.</p>

									<p>Whenever my simple projects need automation it's almost always higher power switching with a microcontroller. I don’t know how many times I’ve set up the same MOSFET circuit on a breadboard with an Arduino, hoping the breadboard doesn’t melt. After enough struggle, I decided it would be a fun project to make a simple microcontroller that controls a MOSFET array. This can be used for many applications such as solenoid switching (as seen on my ventilator project), motor control, or high power LED switching.</p>

									<p>The microcontroller is a basic ATmega328P running at 16MHz with an FTDI breakout for programming. Six of the digital output pins go to Darlington transistors, which allow for 24V switching with a 3A load, leaving a lot of headroom for applications. On top of all of this, the board uses extremely common SMD components and was able to be SMT assembled, saving me from the difficult soldering work. Pictured below on the left is the board getting the through-hole components soldered on and on the right the board driving a 12V 775 motor.</p>

									<p>At the beginning of March 2020, it was clear that the COVID-19 pandemic was taking the world by storm. Hospitals were not equipped to deal with the thousands of new cases popping up daily, increasing at a scary rate. During this huge demand for ventilators and medical equipment, I knew I wanted to do something to help, so I found a competition (Code Life Ventilator Challenge) that brought together engineers, medical professionals, and anyone else that wanted to help to come up with a solution to the ventilator shortage. This competition brought together my team of peers from Waterloo, CSA engineers, and doctors from the Ottawa Hospital. Together over the course of 10 days we designed, built, and tested a functioning ventilator, with myself taking a lot of the mechanical design and documentation work.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<img class="right-picture" src="../assets/Ventilator.png" style="height: calc(11 * 1.5625em); width: auto;">
									<p>Initially, we did a lot of brainstorming to make sure that we could design a simple and effective solution, we came up with the idea of using large disposable syringes that could be easily replaced instead of sanitizing the entire machine. Then we worked on finding materials we could source in a matter of days, this basically limited our selection to Amazon and McMaster Carr. I worked on designing the airway control paths, this included sealing the syringes, sealing the integrated airways, and connecting the solenoid valves. The final design could pump 600ml of proportionally mixed oxygen and air at a pressure of 40cmH2O into a patient. It could withstand the cyclic loading of 800 breathes per hour in simulation, and had adjustable settings on a simple to use Android app. All the parts were shipped to my house, I assembled it in 12 hours and drove it up to Ottawa to be tested the next day. While it was being tested I helped with documentation, including a simple annotated assembly manual for others to use if they wanted to recreate our device.</p>

								<div class="text-box">
									<img class="left-picture" src="../assets/Ventilator Testing.png" style="height: calc(12 * 1.5625em); width: auto;">
									<p>The device was tested successfully with an artificial lung (pictured right) and signed off by doctors at the Ottawa Hospital, but sadly did not qualify to the final round. We were missing a vital part of the requirements; an oxygen sensor, which was extremely difficult to find. Despite this, we posted the files (online) for anyone to access in case they want to build on our progress. Overall I was extremely proud of our team, although we didn’t meet the requirements, we still made something great that had a unique, simple, and effective design.</p>

									<p>As a design challenge, I thought it would be interesting to try 3D printing a basic “air core” motor. Little did I know this would turn into a deep rabbit hole of prototyping, iteration, and learning. After 20+ design iterations, major design changes, and a lot of filament later, I finally had a model that could spin at a decent speed, with a good amount of torque all things considered. The main stator core is made of iron infused PLA filament to increase magnetic flux, wrapped in copper magnet wire. The outer shell of the motor revolves around the stator, housing the magnets in an outrunner fashion. In some prototypes, I was looking at arranging the magnets in a Halbach array but didn’t think the extra diameter and cost was worth the small efficiency gain.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<img class="left-picture" src="../assets/Stator Full Render.png" style="height: calc(12 * 1.5625em); width: auto;">
									<p>During this project, I learned a lot about GD&T, tolerancing, magnetics, electronics, and prototyping as it took many different iterations to get somewhere I was happy with. Obviously, with a large spinning mass, the concentricity is very important, and on a home-built 3D printer this isn’t the easiest thing to do. To get it not to wobble and be perfectly concentric, a lot of tuning had to be done to my printer, and some design changes made it easier to dial in. The stator core also proved difficult, as printing iron particles as a hot liquid is just asking for trouble. A ton of jamming and under extrusion forced me to print the stator in 4 different parts, sliding them onto each other similar to laminates in actual motors, this also theoretically reduced eddy currents. Then the stator was wrapped with magnet wire by hand and soldered together in a wye configuration.</p>

									</div>
									<p>Finally, using a 15A electronic speed controller I was able to get the motor to spin at up to 500rpm (pictured right). Although 3D printing a motor is super impractical, it was a super interesting learning experience and I am glad I went through with the project, despite the many pitfalls.</p>

									<p>(!!!!!!!!!!!!! add flow sim stuff!!!!!!!!!!!!!*****************************!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) I have always had a love for cars, from F1 to sports cars, something about them feels very satisfying. Since the invention of the car, constant iteration on the design has brought us to what we have now. The beautiful curves and fancy body work that makes an automobile, is the product of years of improvements and upgrades. The amount of engineering and design work that makes up an automobile is fascinating to me, and I have always wanted to work in the automotive industry (although I have been told it’s a death wish).</p>

									<p>This project started as an idea when I was in grade 8, using Google sketchup to slowly design a car, line by line. When I got to highschool I realized this was wrong, and stopped the project. In grade 10 I thought it would be cool to bring the project back to life, so starting with the original sketches I started carving out a block of clay. My hope with using clay was to be able to change the design, and try new things fast. This is actually how alot of car companies design their cars at first, by carving full scale models of plasticine.</p>

								<div class="text-box">
									<img class="center-picture" src="../assets/Modelling Process.png" style="height: calc(12 * 1.5625em); width: auto;">
									<p>As seen above, after making a clay model I designed a custom 3D scanner to take a ton of photos from different angles, automatically. After taking 450 pictures of the car, I imported it into Autodesk ReCap and stitched the model together. Then this model was used as a template to resurface in Solidworks, using many 3D sketching techniques. Finally headlights and tail lights were designed, wheels, grilles and other details were added, and the car was ready to be rendered.</p>

									<p>Overall, I learned so much from this project, and hope I can apply it to future projects and coop opportunities. I applied drafting principles to sketching, learned how to model clay, studied and implemented 3D scanning and greatly improved my Solidworks skills.</p>
