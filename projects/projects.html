									<p>While working on other mechanical projects over my life, I always ran into one big problem: manufacturing. Paying a job shop to do a one-off part for me is way too expensive, and only so much can be made at home with basic tools. This problem was partly solved when I built a 3D printer in 2013, but there was still a missing piece; the ability to manufacture metal parts. Sometimes 3D printed plastic is just not good enough and stiffer, stronger materials need to be used. This, along with the challenge of 3 axis machine design enticed me enough to start this project in January of 2020.</p>

									<img class="center-picture" src="../assets/CNC CAD.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>The entire design revolves around a T slot extrusion bed that ensures that the Y-axis rails are parallel and that the gantry structure is reinforced. Because of my manufacturing constraints, most of the parts had to be extrusion or 3D printed, but most of the 3D printed parts were designed to be converted to routered parts down the road. A cool learning experience for me was using topology optimization for a bracket between two pieces of extrusion, while not very practical it did offer me insight into FEA optimization. The entire cost of the machine was kept under $700 by avoiding the use of linear rails and ball screws, which typically push the price of the machine over $2000. Instead, a bearing block style system was used in conjunction with steel reinforced belts. For my purposes, it was an easy and cheap solution that still offers more than enough strength.</p>

								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>The build process was very long, spanning 2 months from April to May, mainly because I wanted to ensure that it was built properly and robustly. The main base is a wood table that I filled with a sand epoxy mixture for dampening and rigidity, everything else is built up from there. Throughout the entire process, I ensured perpendicularity was as close to perfect as possible, and that all dimensions were accurate to reduce tolerance stacks. Something very important I learned while building is just how important wire management is, originally I planned on just using cable sleeves but I realized how easily something could break without proper routing. I settled for a durable drag chain system on the X and Y axes and making everything unpluggable to make troubleshooting much easier.</p>

									<p>The CNC router is still being improved and developed but as of now, it can cut wood, plastics, and aluminum with up to 0.002in accuracy. The T slot table makes work holding super easy with custom clamps or even a machine vice. The router, despite being for wood, is very powerful and can spin at over 30k rpm. In the future, I would like to try more 3D contours and hopefully some PCB milling with extremely small end mills.</p>

									<p>The machine is controlled with a 32 bit ARM processor and an ESP32 module for wifi connectivity and controlling the TFT touchscreen. The processor sends commands to 3 TB6600 stepper controllers that in turn control the NEMA 23 stepper motors on all axes. The ESP32 communicates with the STM32 via serial and can send G-code to jog it, change a tool, probe a tool, and run a program from wifi or an SD card.</p>

									<p>At the beginning of March 2020, it was clear that the COVID-19 pandemic was taking the world by storm. Hospitals were not equipped to deal with the thousands of new cases popping up daily, increasing at a scary rate. During this huge demand for ventilators and medical equipment, I knew I wanted to do something to help, so I found a competition (Code Life Ventilator Challenge) that brought together engineers, medical professionals, and anyone else that wanted to help to come up with a solution to the ventilator shortage. This competition brought together my team of peers from Waterloo, CSA engineers, and doctors from the Ottawa Hospital. Together over the course of 10 days we designed, built, and tested a functioning ventilator, with myself taking a lot of the mechanical design and documentation work.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<img class="right-picture twenty-five-per" src="../assets/Ventilator.png" style="height: auto;">
									<p>Initially, we did a lot of brainstorming to make sure that we could design a simple and effective solution, we came up with the idea of using large disposable syringes that could be easily replaced instead of sanitizing the entire machine. Then we worked on finding materials we could source in a matter of days, this basically limited our selection to Amazon and McMaster Carr. I worked on designing the airway control paths, this included sealing the syringes, sealing the integrated airways, and connecting the solenoid valves. The final design could pump 600ml of proportionally mixed oxygen and air at a pressure of 40cmH2O into a patient. It could withstand the cyclic loading of 800 breathes per hour in simulation, and had adjustable settings on a simple to use Android app. All the parts were shipped to my house, I assembled it in 12 hours and drove it up to Ottawa to be tested the next day. While it was being tested I helped with documentation, including a simple annotated assembly manual for others to use if they wanted to recreate our device.</p>	
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<img class="left-picture" src="../assets/Ventilator Testing.png" style="height: auto;">
									<p>The device was tested successfully with an artificial lung (pictured right) and signed off by doctors at the Ottawa Hospital, but sadly did not qualify to the final round. We were missing a vital part of the requirements; an oxygen sensor, which was extremely difficult to find. Despite this, we posted the files (online) for anyone to access in case they want to build on our progress. Overall I was extremely proud of our team, although we didn’t meet the requirements, we still made something great that had a unique, simple, and effective design.</p>

										When I first came to Waterloo, we had a session to learn about all the student design teams so that we could explore our options. When I talked to members of the Formula Motorsports team, I was instantly hooked. It seemed a lot like FRC from high school, which I was very involved in, so I decided to go. In my first semester, I really wanted to go every week, but due to my schedule it was challenging. But more and more, I started taking on more tasks and gaining responsibility on the team. I decided to join the suspension team, as it has lots of dynamic moving parts and greatly affects the car's performance.</p>

								<div class="text-box">	
									<p>Recently I have been working on the 2021 car suspension, and making sure everything is ready to go to manufacturing and eventually be assembled. The pushrod suspension is constructed out of a lot of hollow tubing, with spherical rod ends used as pivots, giving the tyres an unconstrained vertical motion. The suspension A-arms attach to the wheel and go up to a bell crank that compresses a shock, constraining the system. The roll suspension is also integrated into the bellcrank by having two asymmetrical levers. This way, if both tyres heave at the same rate, the roll suspension doesn’t compress. But, if there is more force on one side than the other, the roll suspension starts reacting back. The design (seen above, censored until public release) is super compact and works very well in practice.</p>

The challenge was to pick up a 40lb barbell weight and throw footballs into field goals. The competition gave us 48 hours to fully design a functional robot in a team of 3, a challenge that I underestimated at the beginning.

In the preliminary design phase, I decided it would be easiest to store the football horizontally so that it wouldn’t have an option but to stay in that orientation, since it has the smallest radius. I later decided this would be the best orientation to shoot in as well, giving the ball a spiral to keep it stable. Both my designs can be seen below, keeping in mind they were designed very quickly, leaving time for integration and rendering.</p>

To accomplish this we designed a custom bushing that the ball could be passed through, this bushing was mounted to a ring gear so the entire shooter could be rotated. In addition to this, the length of the hood could be adjusted on the fly for different shot lengths.</p>

								<div class="text-box">
									<p>In my first year Mechatronics Engineering course we had a final design project, in which we were tasked in making an automated device with a Lego EV3 robotics kit. With the recent interest in origami from me and my friends, we thought it would be an awesome project to try to fold origami. But after looking at some preliminary designs we had, we figured it would be way too hard with the 4 motors we were limited to. So as a compromise we decided to make an origami creasing machine, one that you could import a picture of a folding pattern, and it would crease a paper on both sides to show the user where the folds needed to be. To do this we designed, built, and programmed a 4 axis CNC, with a rotating creasing wheel, pictured below. On the team, I handled the mechanical design, the build, and the control system code.</p>

								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>Since we wanted to make the device easy to use for anyone, we wanted to make a “CAM” program of sorts. The simplest way we found to do this was to have the user draw blue or red lines on a square piece of paper, blue being a down fold and red being an up fold (seen below). This picture would be read into an OpenCV program that would detect the coordinate endpoints of these lines, and output a custom “G-code” of all the coordinates of crease lines to a text file, automatically optimizing them. Then the EV3 could interpret the text file and crease all the lines on one side of the paper, prompting the user to flip the page, and then finishing the lines on the other side.</p>

									<p>The main XY system is a basic gantry system using threaded rod and smooth rod. Since our time and budget was constrained we picked a very basic system, using a threaded rod kept the cost low yet allowed our machine to be precise. On top of this, by using a synchro shaft on the Y axis, we were able to drive two threaded rods with one servo motor.</p>

								<div class="text-box">
									<p>Holding the end effector is an extremely compact but simple Z and C axis. The Z-axis used a small lead screw and box way slides and was driven with the smaller servo motor. The Z-axis was retained in a ring gear that was responsible for spinning the creasing wheel. By rotating the entire Z-axis a much smaller sub-assembly was possible, as opposed to moving a rotational axis up and down. At the end of this assembly is a creasing wheel or “pizza cutter” which is essentially a sharp wheel to crease the paper.</p>

								<div class="text-box">
									<p>Keeping the paper down without damaging it was a big problem that we faced in the design phase, as paper is delicate and needs to be intact for origami to work. In addition to this, to make deep crease marks in the paper, it was necessary to allow the creasing wheel to push the paper into something compliant, thus wrapping the paper around the wheel. To tackle these problems we made a simple vacuum table with a shop vac and a perforated foam sheet, which allowed us to vary the compliance of the foam and the strength of the work holding.</p>

The 2019 FRC challenge was based on securing “rockets” with cargo and panels to seal the cargo in. It involved manipulating and scoring rubber balls, and attaching thin plastic discs to velcro on the rocket.

									<p>As a design challenge, I thought it would be interesting to try 3D printing a basic “air core” motor. Little did I know this would turn into a deep rabbit hole of prototyping, iteration, and learning. After 20+ design iterations, major design changes, and a lot of filament later, I finally had a model that could spin at a decent speed, with a good amount of torque all things considered. The main stator core is made of iron infused PLA filament to increase magnetic flux, wrapped in copper magnet wire. The outer shell of the motor revolves around the stator, housing the magnets in an outrunner fashion. In some prototypes, I was looking at arranging the magnets in a Halbach array but didn’t think the extra diameter and cost was worth the small efficiency gain.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<img class="left-picture twenty-five-per" src="../assets/Stator Full Render.png" style="height: auto;">
									<p>During this project, I learned a lot about GD&T, tolerancing, magnetics, electronics, and prototyping as it took many different iterations to get somewhere I was happy with. Obviously, with a large spinning mass, the concentricity is very important, and on a home-built 3D printer this isn’t the easiest thing to do. To get it not to wobble and be perfectly concentric, a lot of tuning had to be done to my printer, and some design changes made it easier to dial in. The stator core also proved difficult, as printing iron particles as a hot liquid is just asking for trouble. A ton of jamming and under extrusion forced me to print the stator in 4 different parts, sliding them onto each other similar to laminates in actual motors, this also theoretically reduced eddy currents. Then the stator was wrapped with magnet wire by hand and soldered together in a wye configuration.</p>

									<p>Finally, using a 15A electronic speed controller I was able to get the motor to spin at up to 500rpm (pictured right). Although 3D printing a motor is super impractical, it was a super interesting learning experience and I am glad I went through with the project, despite the many pitfalls.</p>

									<p>I have always had a love for cars, from F1 to sports cars, something about them feels very satisfying. Since the invention of the car, constant iteration on the design has brought us to what we have now. The beautiful curves and fancy bodywork that makes an automobile is the product of years of improvements and upgrades. The amount of engineering and design work that makes up an automobile is fascinating to me, and I have always wanted to work in the automotive industry (although I have been told it’s a death wish).</p>

									<p>This project started as an idea when I was in grade 8, using Google SketchUp to slowly design a car, line by line. When I got to high school I learned about proper CAD software and stopped the project. In grade 10 I thought it would be cool to bring the project back to life, so starting with the original sketches I started carving out a block of clay. My hope with using clay was to be able to change the design and try new things fast. This is actually how a lot of car companies design their cars at first, by carving full-scale models of plasticine.</p>

									<p>As seen above, after making a clay model I designed a custom 3D scanner to take a ton of photos from different angles, automatically. After taking 450 pictures of the car, I imported it into Autodesk ReCap and stitched the model together. Then this model was used as a template to resurface in Solidworks, using many 3D sketching and surfacing techniques. This surface model was tweaked until I was happy with the flow simulation results and the drag coefficient of ~0.28. Finally, headlights and tail lights were designed, wheels, grilles, and other details were added, and the car was ready to be rendered.</p>

									<p>During the University of Toronto’s “MakeUofT” 24 hour hackathon, my team of 4 decided to mod a Prusa i3 to make it more autonomous. Even though hobby 3D printers are amazing, and can be fairly maintenance-free, they aren’t autonomous and still require someone to manage them. Our idea was simple, allow the printer to be able to clear and clean its build plate, monitor its status, and start a print remotely. Since the printer can clear and clean its build plate, it can hypothetically print over and over again.</p>

								<div class="image-box">
									<img class="center-picture sixty-per" src="../assets/Autonoprint Render.png">
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>To do this, I designed a “scraper arm” that would be lowered across the print bed, locking into a slot on the opposite side. With a scraper flush on the bed, when the bed is moved at full speed, the print easily pops off. While moving, isopropyl alcohol is pumped under the scraper and in front of the wiper, cleaning the PEI coating on the bed from any oil or debris.</p>

								<div class="text-box">
									<p>In addition to the scraper arm, we added a Raspberry Pi that could control the printer from a web server, cueing prints, moving the axis and live streaming a video feed. On the Raspberry Pi, we used a program called “Spaghetti Detective” to automatically detect failed prints, which would then trigger our scraper arm to remove the print and start over.</p>

									<p>One of my favourite activities, starting from a young age at summer camp, is sailing. Except, like many other enjoyable things, it takes a lot of work. Twice a year the docks need to be moved, which means many days of work and manual labour. As a solution to this, the club decided to come up with a better solution, a trailer to pull the docks up with a car. I ended up designing and validating it, ensuring that it would survive the harsh Canadian climate, the lake water, and the repetitive loads.</p>

									<p>The trailer was designed for the sole purpose of lifting 500+ lb docks out of the water and holding them securely while a truck could pull them up the boat launch. It also has a secondary purpose of lifting a 400+ lb mast crane (pictured below). It is used around 20 times a year at the Mississauga Sailing Club and saves a ton of time.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>The main frame is constructed with hollow steel tubing, making it relatively light but more than strong enough. Since almost the entire assembly has to be submerged in lake water, it is important that it is corrosion-resistant. The cheapest way to do this was to assembly it and then hot-dip galvanize it, protecting it from rust.</p>

									<p>I learned a lot about structural design working on this project, the heavy docks and trailer hitch presented a lot of static equilibrium problems. Ensuring that the dock didn’t prematurely corrode was also important, and required me to learn about different corrosion resistance options.</p>

We designed a very unique robot with mechanisms designed to speed up cycles and work well with other teammates.

									<p>In my grade 10 years, I took on the role of design lead on my FRC team, during the Steamworks season. The game was designed around Wiffle balls (fuel) which had to be scored in a low and high goal, and large plastic gears that had to be placed on a spring. The strategic approach we took was to cycle as many gears as possible, and as a secondary function, we would assist our team mates in scoring fuel balls. Our robot, named The Beast, used rubberized conveyor rollers, and a sliding pocket to hold gears.</p>

								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>The gear mechanism eventually got fast enough to allow our robot to do 10-11 cycles a game, something that few teams achieved in the competition. Despite this advantage we had over other teams, one strategic point we oversaw was the low fuel scoring vs. the high fuel scoring, which was worth 3x as many points per ball. Because of this, after the season finished I made it a side project to design a turret shooter (pictured below) for this game, and we prototyped it after to learn things for future years (something that came in handy in 2020).</p>
