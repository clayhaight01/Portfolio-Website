				<h2>2020 F4 CADathon Robot</h2>

					<p>After the 2020 FRC competition was cancelled by COVID-19, I decided to join a CAD competition based on a sports challenge, with two of my close friends. The challenge was to pick up a 40lb barbell weight and throw footballs into field goals. The competition gave us 48 hours to fully design a functional robot in a team of 3, a challenge that I underestimated at the beginning. Below is our final assembly that we submitted with, overall it placed 16th across over 150 teams.</p>

					<p>My role on the team was designing the football shooter and feeder system. In the preliminary design phase, I decided it would be easiest to store the football horizontally so that it wouldn’t have an option but to stay in that orientation, since it has the smallest radius. I later decided this would be the best orientation to shoot in as well, giving the ball a spiral to keep it stable. Both my designs can be seen below, keeping in mind they were designed very quickly, leaving time for integration and rendering.</p>
