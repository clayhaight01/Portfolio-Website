									<p>Despite coronavirus pushing hackathons entirely online, some of my highschool friends wanted to compete in a hackathon to help gain some experience. We decided to apply to Hack Western and competed in it this past weekend, winning the Telus Mental Health Award. We started out knowing that we wanted to do something related to mental health in the pandemic setting, as it is now affecting more people than ever. We asked ourselves, what is one thing that was lost due to the pandemic and that a lot of people need, and that ended up being simply talking to someone. And thus the idea for VenTalk was born, an anonymous messaging platform for people to vent, or just casually talk.</p>

									<p>Even though I didn’t have any experience in making an app I still found a lot of ways to help. I used a Web API to compare sentences together and return the similarity as a percentage, and wrote an algorithm based on that to match up users based on the time they've been waiting and the similarity they have with another user. This allowed the app to connect people very quickly and (hopefully) they can talk about a common problem. I also shot and edited the video for our pitch which was a big reason why we won. Feel free to check out my Devpost for more information.</p>

								<div class="text-box">
									<p>As the final part of my CNC project, I needed a way to secure material to the table. A common way to do this is a lever that pulls down applying a force to the workpiece. To adjust heights, the lever is placed on a “step block” that resembles a staircase. I liked this solution but I had two problems with it. First, they are generally pretty short and can’t hold work that is in the middle of a wasteboard. Second, the ends of them are usually flat, which puts a lot of force on a sharp edge which could lead to denting and more scrap. My solution for this was very simple, an arm with a round “finger”, that could better distribute the force.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="image-box">
									<img class="center-picture sixty-per" src="./assets/Work Holding.png">
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>I really wasn’t sure what kind of forces I could achieve with this, and I wanted to ensure I could keep the workpiece solid, as it is a very common failure of CNC routers. To calculate what forces I needed, I used the coefficients of static friction between some of the common materials I cut, and whatever they were secured to. The smallest coefficient (between the MDF waste board and the aluminum table) represents what will slip first from cutting forces. Using a rough estimate of cutting forces and the friction equation, I was able to calculate that I need 366.7N of force on the end of the finger. To get this force, the bolt would have to exert 620.6N of force, bending the finger.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="image-box">
									<img class="center-picture sixty-per" src="./assets/Work Holding Math.png">
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>To ensure that the finger wouldn’t bend and potentially break I ran an FEA simulation. Since I was printing the parts solid I assumed that the simulation would be similar to real life. In the first simulation I ran, the maximum displacement was around 2.10mm, then I made the part taller to increase its area moment of inertia. In the second simulation I ran (below, left) the displacement dropped down to 1.04mm, and finally, I made the part a bit wider and achieved a maximum displacement of 0.0873mm (below right).</p>

								<div class="text-box">
									<p>All in all, I was very happy with the results, and I hope when I test them out they will work reliably. The worst thing I would want is to waste a work in progress part because it slipped out of work holding.</p>

									<p>Recently my roommates got into YoYoing, something that I didn’t realize there was still a following for. The most interesting part to me was the extremely specialty bearings (costing up to $40) that can spin under their own mass moment of inertia. When the large “butterfly” shaped flywheel is added, a good yoyo can freespin for more than 10 minutes. This, of course, interested me, and in my free time after studying I decided to start designing a yoyo bearing.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="image-box">
									<img class="center-picture sixty-per" src="./assets/Bearings.png">
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>I did some basic research on bearing design, types of races, arches and filling methods. I knew I would have to play around with clearances a lot, to make a free-spinning bearing the clearances need to be pretty loose. I started with a large 2 point contact bearing with a channel to fill the balls (1), then I tried slowly increasing the preload in iterations (2) and (3). Once I found the right clearance to use, I shrunk the design (4) and experimented with a gothic arch style (5). The 4 point contact style of the gothic arch added too much static friction, so I went back to the 2 point contact in iteration (6).</p>

									<p>Overall I learned about how bearings are designed, and the different styles used to construct them and make them function. Even though 3D printed plastic is not ideal for bearing races, it did help me learn a lot and experiment quickly. At the end of this, I used bearing (6) to make a yoyo (pictured below), and it free spun for around a minute!</p>

									<p>When I was in elementary school, I was teaching myself basic electronics principles, components and circuits. One of my show and tell assignments I actually brought an astable multivibrator circuit. Going into middle school I started trying to apply this knowledge, trying to make a go-cart, small “robots” and other similar things. When I got into microcontrollers in grade 6, it really took off my passion for tinkering, because now I could program my projects and add so much more value to them. In grade 7 after some Arduino experience, I built my first decent project, a pair of smart glasses with a TFT screen and voice control (pictured below). Now I never said I was good at making things look professional, but it still impressed people, making it to reporters at Makezine, Time, and the Discovery channel. With this media attention, it caught the eyes of the Glass division at Google, who sent me a gift package in the mail which made 13 year old me really happy.</p>

									<p>The next year I wanted to try making one of my dream projects come to life, I wanted to make a full-body exoskeleton capable of giving me extra strength and speed. Maybe that was too much of an ambitious goal for a 15-year-old... Despite the massive challenge this would pose, I went to work designing, 3D printing and prototyping parts for it. Realizing that this would end up costing a lot of money, I launched the product on Kickstarter, offering some rewards for people that helped fund my project. The project was funded successfully, allowing me to buy some of the expensive equipment and components.</p>

								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>One of the most interesting things I developed for the project was a super light, powerful and compliant actuator. This “air muscle” was constructed with a soft, flexible tube that when pressurized would expand, pulling a braided sleeve and contracting (pictured below). Another thing I tried to do was to make the exoskeleton take all the weight off of the legs, which didn’t end up working well, but the principles were there. This was done with over-center locking mechanisms, extending from the “spine” to the knees, allowing a load on the back to be transferred directly to the feet (pictured below).</p>

									<p>After applying for jobs in my 1B school term, in the summer of 2020, I realized that having an easy to access portfolio could really help me. Before this website, I would just hope that employers and recruiters would see the little “see portfolio” note on my resume. But now it's easy to provide a link to my website where people can see my experience, projects and well, this blog.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>At the end of the term, I was watching some videos on HTML and CSS to try and learn some basic skills. Once I got the basics down, I drafted the look of this website in Figma and translated that into HTML and CSS. The hardest part for me was writing all the content, consolidating all my projects, and making sure they all had enough pictures and renders.</p>
