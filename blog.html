					<p>Although it seems counter intuitive, in 2020, while I was locked up in my room, I didn’t read very many books. This led me to set a goal for 2021, to read one book a month. This seems like a pretty low number for people who regularly read, but as a busy university student who is already forced to read lots of textbooks, reading was not my favourite thing to do in my down time.</p>

					<p>This was poor bedtime reading material, but that being said I learned so much. It's hard to learn GD&T without working directly with it in a shop, but I feel like this textbook removed that barrier. I learned about lots of standard practices, geometric controls, and all about ASME Y14.5. Definitely would recommend this textbook for anyone that wants an introduction into GD&T and drawing.</p>

					<b>INSPIRED: How to Create Tech Products Customers Love by Marty Cagan</b>
				</div>
				<div class="text-box">
					<p>Personally, I didn’t really enjoy this book. I found it to be very dry and it talked a lot more about power structures and management than it did about how to actually build great products. I was hoping it would be more practical; explaining certain traits that iconic product designers and managers had that set them apart, and how to develop those traits. Although it did mention some iconic people, it was very brief and wasn’t the main focus of the book. I suppose I would recommend it to people that want to become product managers at big companies whilst still making an impact, but for everyone else, I don’t think it offered too much.</p>

					<p>This relatively short read was amazing, and I recommend it to anyone trying to find a good product market fit. The book, although published in 1960, manages to accurately predict the future through some basic logic. For example, one of the passages in the book predicts that oil companies should transition to electric energy in the future, as cars and other transportation methods will eventually switch to electricity. And this was in 1960!</p>

					<p>The book makes the argument that sometimes unconventional and illogical ideas are the best ones, and end up turning out the best. Some of the main things talked about in the book are the butterfly effect, changing your perspective when thinking about problems, and doing counterintuitive things on purpose. Another one of the main things that comes up often in the book is how big companies take little risk, because they have so much to lose. And that people in those companies don’t take big risks because it could mean failing and not being promoted; when really failure is something that should be acknowledged and learned from.</p>

									<h2 class="portfolio-title">UW Bridge Competition</h2>
									<p class="portfolio-subtitle">My design process in a class wide bridge building competition</p>
								</div>
							</div>
							<div class="portfolio-content">
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>As part of my Mechanics of Deformable Solids (MODS) course we had to design and build a truss bridge using things we learned in class. This project was done in groups of 3 and was worth a significant amount of our final mark. Most of the mark was based on how your bridge performed in a competition with the rest of the class, with the success metric being the weight it held divided by the weight of the bridge.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>I took the initiative to do the design portion of the project and started laying out requirements and goals for the project. The bridge had to span a 40cm gap, be no taller than 10cm, no wider than 8cm, and be loaded in the center of the bridge. We were limited to using laser-cut balsa wood and hardwood dowels for the pin joints.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="image-box">
									<img class="center-picture sixty-per" src="./assets/Bridge Outline.png">
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>To start the design I thought about some typical truss bridge shapes and layouts, but after some pondering I determined that minimizing the amount of members would be beneficial. This is because with more members, the chances of one having a weak point or a tolerance issue and being a “weak link” would be detrimental. From this I came up with two bridge designs, shown below.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="image-box">
									<img class="center-picture forty-per" src="./assets/Bridge Sim.png">
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>I ended up picking the 7 member truss since Euler's critical buckling load gets smaller with 1/L², and the 3 member truss has a much longer compression members. We knew we wanted to break last year's record of 598 g/g, so we aimed for a score of 700. From here, using an estimated bridge weight an approximate load can be calculated. I then used formulas to optimize the design, ensuring all failure modes would meet or exceed the load goal. I also used empirical testing with my team members on some test pieces we got cut. This was used to verify material properties and formula estimations. For example, to optimize the width of the members under compression I determined what fraction of the load they took, and used basic formulas to determine a thickness. We then tested those members under tension to see if they met the estimation, which they did. An analysis of the material properties can be seen below.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="image-box">
									<img class="center-picture forty-per" src="./assets/Material Data.png">
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>From here we got our bridge manufactured and tested it. We saw something that we didn’t predict happening; the bridge was twisting and shifting as we added more weight. It only made it to a score of 380, which was not up to our standards. We caught it on video and analyzed it to improve our next iteration (seen below).</p>
								</div>
								<div class="image-box">
									<img class="center-picture forty-per" src="./assets/Bridge Test 1.jpg">
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>To reduce the twisting we added cross members and hole supports to make the holes longer. After testing it, it successfully reached a score of 600 before twisting itself to pieces yet again. Our final iteration was the one we had to submit, no more testing, so we added even more twisting supports and handed it in hoping for the best.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="image-box">
									<img class="center-picture forty-per" src="./assets/Bridge Twist Supports.png">
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>Despite a really poor video quality, our bridge looked like it just kept taking more and more weight. It successfully broke the record and came 1st in the class. The final PV ratio was 649, breaking at 10kg and weighing a mere 15.4 grams. Despite not meeting the designed goal of 700, I am still proud of our team and the outcome of the competition.</p>

									<p class="portfolio-subtitle">A rapid prototype of smart tongs, to help with food safety</p>
								</div>
							</div>
							<div class="portfolio-content">
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>During the winter break I worked with 2 of my coworkers at Gastronomous to develop a prototype for an idea we had. The idea came after meeting with one of Canada’s largest restaurant brands, where they told us they have problems keeping a log of burger temperatures. We came up with a pair of “smart tongs” that could measure the internal temperature of anything you pick up with them. By doing this they can ensure that their grill is hot enough, the grill worker is cooking them thoroughly and most importantly they aren't serving undercooked food. We wanted to prototype this as soon as possible, so that we could present them to potential customers in the new year.</p>

								<div class="image-box">
									<img class="center-picture sixty-per" src="./assets/Gastrometer Side View.jpg">
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>We first laid out our criteria and constraints, we knew what we wanted but had to make sure we met all the requirements and didn’t skimp or go overboard on features. After determining what the product needed to do we started brainstorming ways to go about the electronics, software and design. To make a rapid prototype we used as many off the shelf parts as possible. We used a pair of tongs from a barbecue store, a pre-existing microcontroller, and avoided PCB manufacturing companies by making PCBs on my CNC router.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="image-box">
									<img class="center-picture sixty-per" src="./assets/Gastrometer Prototype.png">
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>For the electronics we decided to use an ESP8266 microcontroller to give the tongs wifi functionality; allowing them to display a live log on a webapp. We used an off the shelf burger thermocouple, paired with an ADC. For the interface with the user we used a simple button and an OLED display. I designed the power control circuitry while my coworker designed the control board.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="image-box">
									<img class="center-picture sixty-per" src="./assets/VR PCB Dev.png">
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>I designed the enclosure for the electronics, and tried to make it as sleek as possible (albeit the electronics are pretty large, and it ended up pretty bulky). I also designed the webapp using HTML and CSS running on the ESP8266 as a webserver. Finally I assembled the tongs, and mounted everything to them.</p>

									<p>The tongs work really well, they can detect when a burger is at a proper internal temperature and automatically log the time, temperature, and pass/fail to a webapp. For a 3 day prototype I am very proud of the end result!</p>

									<p>Despite coronavirus pushing hackathons entirely online, some of my highschool friends wanted to compete in a hackathon to help gain some experience. We decided to apply to Hack Western and competed in it this past weekend, winning the Telus Mental Health Award. We started out knowing that we wanted to do something related to mental health in the pandemic setting, as it is now affecting more people than ever. We asked ourselves, what is one thing that was lost due to the pandemic and that a lot of people need, and that ended up being simply talking to someone. And thus the idea for VenTalk was born, an anonymous messaging platform for people to vent, or just casually talk.</p>

									<p>Even though I didn’t have any experience in making an app I still found a lot of ways to help. I used a Web API to compare sentences together and return the similarity as a percentage, and wrote an algorithm based on that to match up users based on the time they've been waiting and the similarity they have with another user. This allowed the app to connect people very quickly and (hopefully) they can talk about a common problem. I also shot and edited the video for our pitch which was a big reason why we won.

								</div>
							</div>
							<div class="portfolio-content">
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>As the final part of my CNC project, I needed a way to secure material to the table. A common way to do this is a lever that pulls down applying a force to the workpiece. To adjust heights, the lever is placed on a “step block” that resembles a staircase. I liked this solution but I had two problems with it. First, they are generally pretty short and can’t hold work that is in the middle of a wasteboard. Second, the ends of them are usually flat, which puts a lot of force on a sharp edge which could lead to denting and more scrap. My solution for this was very simple, an arm with a round “finger”, that could better distribute the force.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="image-box">
									<img class="center-picture sixty-per" src="./assets/Work Holding.png">
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>I really wasn’t sure what kind of forces I could achieve with this, and I wanted to ensure I could keep the workpiece solid, as it is a very common failure of CNC routers. To calculate what forces I needed, I used the coefficients of static friction between some of the common materials I cut, and whatever they were secured to. The smallest coefficient (between the MDF waste board and the aluminum table) represents what will slip first from cutting forces. Using a rough estimate of cutting forces and the friction equation, I was able to calculate that I need 366.7N of force on the end of the finger. To get this force, the bolt would have to exert 620.6N of force, bending the finger.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="image-box">
									<img class="center-picture sixty-per" src="./assets/Work Holding Math.png">
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>To ensure that the finger wouldn’t bend and potentially break I ran an FEA simulation. Since I was printing the parts solid I assumed that the simulation would be similar to real life. In the first simulation I ran, the maximum displacement was around 2.10mm, then I made the part taller to increase its area moment of inertia. In the second simulation I ran (below, left) the displacement dropped down to 1.04mm, and finally, I made the part a bit wider and achieved a maximum displacement of 0.0873mm (below right).</p>

								<div class="text-box">
									<p>All in all, I was very happy with the results, and I hope when I test them out they will work reliably. The worst thing I would want is to waste a work in progress part because it slipped out of work holding.</p>

									<p>Recently my roommates got into YoYoing, something that I didn’t realize there was still a following for. The most interesting part to me was the extremely specialty bearings (costing up to $40) that can spin under their own mass moment of inertia. When the large “butterfly” shaped flywheel is added, a good yoyo can freespin for more than 10 minutes. This, of course, interested me, and in my free time after studying I decided to start designing a yoyo bearing.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="image-box">
									<img class="center-picture sixty-per" src="./assets/Bearings.png">
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>I did some basic research on bearing design, types of races, arches and filling methods. I knew I would have to play around with clearances a lot, to make a free-spinning bearing the clearances need to be pretty loose. I started with a large 2 point contact bearing with a channel to fill the balls (1), then I tried slowly increasing the preload in iterations (2) and (3). Once I found the right clearance to use, I shrunk the design (4) and experimented with a gothic arch style (5). The 4 point contact style of the gothic arch added too much static friction, so I went back to the 2 point contact in iteration (6).</p>

									<p>Overall I learned about how bearings are designed, and the different styles used to construct them and make them function. Even though 3D printed plastic is not ideal for bearing races, it did help me learn a lot and experiment quickly. At the end of this, I used bearing (6) to make a yoyo (pictured below), and it free spun for around a minute!</p>

									<p>When I was in elementary school, I was teaching myself basic electronics principles, components and circuits. Going into middle school I started trying to apply this knowledge, trying to make a go-cart, small “robots” and other similar things. When I got into microcontrollers in grade 6, my passion for tinkering really took off, because now I could program my projects and add so much more value to them. In grade 7 after some Arduino experience, I built my first decent project, a pair of smart glasses with a TFT screen and voice control (pictured below).</p>

									<p>Now I never said I was good at making things look professional, but it still impressed people, making it to reporters at Makezine, Time, and the Discovery channel. With this media attention, it caught the eyes of the Glass division at Google, who sent me a gift package in the mail which made 13 year old me really happy.</p>

									<p>The next year I wanted to try making one of my dream projects come to life, I wanted to make a full-body exoskeleton capable of giving me extra strength and speed. Maybe that was too much of an ambitious goal for a 15-year-old... Despite the massive challenge this would pose, I went to work designing, 3D printing and prototyping parts for it. Realizing that this would end up costing a lot of money, I launched the project on Kickstarter, offering some rewards for people that helped out. The project was funded successfully, allowing me to buy some of the expensive equipment and components necessary.</p>

									<p>I learned so much doing this project and some really valuable lessons that helped me become the person I am today. I realize, looking back, that it was extremely sketchy, and so many things were done wrong. But I am glad it went that way because I learned so much.</p>

									<p>One of the most interesting things I developed for the project was a super light, powerful and compliant actuator. This “air muscle” was constructed with a soft, flexible tube that when pressurized would expand, pulling a braided sleeve and contracting (pictured below). Another thing I tried to do was to make the exoskeleton take all the weight off of the legs, which didn’t end up working well, but the principles were there. This was done with over-center locking mechanisms, extending from the “spine” to the knees, allowing a load on the back to be transferred directly to the feet (pictured below).</p>

									<p>After applying for jobs in my 1B school term, in the summer of 2020, I realized that having an easy to access portfolio could really help me. Before this website, I would just hope that employers and recruiters would see the little “see portfolio” note on my resume. But now it's easy to provide a link to my website where people can see my experience, projects and well, this blog.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>At the end of the term, I was watching some videos on HTML and CSS to try and learn some basic skills. Once I got the basics down, I drafted the look of this website in Figma and translated that into HTML and CSS. The hardest part for me was writing all the content, consolidating all my projects, and making sure they all had enough pictures and renders.</p>

									<p>I learned a lot of skills from this project, and maybe one day I will improve the website since it is still in its first draft. I hope to keep it updated with blog posts, job experience and any new projects I do.</p>
