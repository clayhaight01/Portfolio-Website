								<div class="text-box">
									<p>As a university student with little free time it probably doesn’t come as a surprise to you that I have never gained the appreciation for cooking a nice meal, nevertheless becoming good at cooking. I also have a low attention span, and a need to be hyper productive. It takes 20 minutes for the rice to cook? Well you can find me back at my desk working on something - and the pot will almost surely boil over every single time.
									</p>
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>I have had a dream for a while about a smart kitchen assistant based around the stove top (where most of the fuck-ups happen). The MVP is a device that can set timers, check temperatures and guide you through a recipe. Adding on to this, some nice to have features would be: boil over/burning detection, cooked thoroughly estimation, temperature recommendations (turn the stove down it's too hot), portioning estimation (“this is too much rice for 4 people”), integration with other smart kitchen appliances (automatic stove top dials, automatic rice cooker, smart fridge shopping list, etc.).
									</p>
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>Essentially, the MVP should be able to prevent me from burning my steaks and leaving the rice to boil for too long. Nice to have features as listed above would allow for “guided cooking” where all the risky parts of the recipe are being monitored by an agent that doesn’t get tired of staring at a pan.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>The closest thing I have found to this is the GE Kitchen Hub (which is pretty much just an iPad on a range hood, it doesn’t even interact with the food at all, just brings up recipes) and Domino’s DOM AI which scans pizzas before they go out for delivery.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>I want to pursue this, but don’t have the free time or energy currently. I am hoping writing this and making my idea public will encourage me to get to work.</p>

								</div>
							</div>
							<div class="portfolio-content">
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>In a series of blog posts about product visions I have, I want to prove the need and usefulness of products using first principles. First principles might be a bit liberal - I’d call it more of a logical deduction, but that being said I think it speaks to the need for these products to solve problems.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>A problem thats always bothered me (as well as other people from what I’ve been told) is waking up in the morning. Currently, hundreds of millions (probably billions) of people around the world have Apples “Radar” alarm permanently ingrained into their brain - you know what I’m talking about. The fact that we force our brains out of sleep cycle with a vexatious alarm literally named “Radar” is not right, and it's something I would like to fix.
									</p>
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>If we think about how cave men and even animals wakeup, it is purely based on a daylight cycle, and doesn’t involve alarms at all. Daylight is subtle enough that it will only wake you up when you’re in a light, easy to wake state.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>It is widely known that it is best to wake up in a light sleep state, and after a REM period. Studies from sleep scientists including Matthew Walker and Andrew Huberman show that it is more beneficial to your sleep cycle to wake up during these times, as opposed to waking up after exactly X amount of hours. To do this properly, a wakeup signal needs to be just disturbing enough to wake you up in a light state, but not in a REM or deep state.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>In addition to this, light has been shown to be very important to the wakeup cycle. Andrew Huberman suggests daylight every morning, quoted as saying “If sunlight reaches your eyes soon after you wake, it triggers a neural circuit that controls the timing of the hormones cortisol and melatonin, which affect sleep”. I believe that waking up to an alarm sound is extremely bad for your wake up cycle, and I can personally say that obnoxious noises just cause headaches, and eventually you just get used to ignoring them.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>This is why I decided to build Kurt. Kurt is a curtain opener that makes smart, informed decisions about your sleep cycle to wake you up with natural light and calming noises. Unlike current robotic curtain openers, Kurt is first an al*rm clock, and second a smart home appliance. Kurt can only open your blinds, not close them. This is on purpose, manually closing your blinds sends an automatic signal to Kurt to let it know you are going to sleep soon. From that point, your desired sleep time is measured, after which your curtains are opened and you can wake up peacefully.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="image-box">

								</div>

									<p>I do not have the bandwidth to turn this into a product, but I do think it could be an interesting business venture. Check out the Kurt website under my project section.</p>

								</div>
							</div>
							<div class="portfolio-content">
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>The reason this list exists is that I have noticed I see a lot of startups where my first thought is: “I had that idea 2 years ago!” but I never keep the receipts. I also want to start cutting ties with old ideas to force myself into fresh ones. So here it is, free ideas that I will personally never see through, but would love to see come to life! I hope they don’t sound too insane.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<b>1. A way to sell ideas (February 2021)</b>
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>Now I know what you’re thinking - Clayton, you’re giving these ideas away for free, how would you possibly put a price on an idea? Well, I have no idea! But ideas have value, some startups even choose to hide their ideas from the general public, in fear that it may be ripped off. Oftentimes by joining an early phase startup, you are investing yourself in the idea itself, not necessarily the company or the people it is made up of.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>I personally think that a lot of people have great startup ideas but don’t have the time or resources to execute on them, so spreading them around to people with time and resources would be a win-win scenario.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>I have thought of one implementation of how this could work - but I am sure someone else can come up with something better. Imagine a website like Product Hunt but, but creators could be “vetted” and charge for their ideas. You wouldn’t be able to see the full idea until you pay, but you would be able to see the general genre or topic of the idea. Secondary people could be paid to evaluate and rate the ideas, but sign an agreement saying they won’t pursue anything they see on the website. That way, if some wannabe founders want to do, say, some solar power energy company, they can find ideas related to solar power, buy them up, and decide where to go from there.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<b>2. Grocery stores built around recipes (April 2020)</b>
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>I believe there should be a grocery service where you order recipes, not groceries. And I think the current trend of food delivery can greatly set this up for success.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>I have always found it really silly that we buy ingredients to make recipes, and that in your fridge at any given time, there is almost certainly leftover ingredients from a recipe you were following that you will never use again. Sure there are staples that every kitchen pantry/fridge should have, sugar, salt, rice, etc. But for the most part, recipes create additional food waste.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>Another trend that is getting closer to this, is realizing that grocery delivery can actually be more environmentally friendly. Services like Voilà have one delivery van that can cover maybe 10-20 houses worth of food, avoiding those 10-20 drivers from individually driving to the store, shopping, and driving back. In the future, it will be very uncommon to go to a grocery store, instead your essentials will be delivered to you.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>So now imagine a service where you can order 4 servings of cedar planked salmon, and 8 servings of french onion soup. All the ingredients would be portioned such that you shouldn’t have any waste at the end. And since the grocery stores can now share ingredients across different recipes, they should also be able to minimize waste.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>I suppose services like HelloFresh are similar to this, but there are two problems with it. The first is that you are forced to select from their weekly menu, greatly limiting the customer base. The second is how expensive it is. If you were to copy the recipes and pro rate those ingredients at the grocery store I guarantee it would be >50% less money. Yes, it includes delivery, but by using a bulk delivery van system similar to Amazon Prime I think this cost could be greatly reduced.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<b>3. Customizable multi tools (2014)</b>
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>When I was in middle school I was really into EDC, or every day carry. It's essentially all about carrying essential tools daily with you. Typically, this includes some sort of knife or multitool like a swiss army knife or a leatherman. The problem I have with these two companies is that they have models with a set amount of tools. So if you specifically need scissors, a file, and a phillips screwdriver, you might be stuck with a huge tool with a bunch of other useless stuff, or they may not even have an option for you.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>In grade 7, after looking at how swiss army knives work, I realized that all the tools are essentially the same. They use the same spring-cam mechanism, and have one of two form factors - full length or half length. My idea was to have a multitool with an expandable frame, so that you could add or remove tools yourself, and sell the tools separately. This way you buy the frame, the tools you want, and assemble your own multitool. As the seasons change or your daily job changes, you could switch the tools out. After getting quotes from suppliers in China to make tool samples I gave up - grade 7 me could not afford tool and die costs.</p>

									<p class="portfolio-subtitle">Weekly blog of my trip to California over Summer 2021</p>
								</div>
							</div>
							<div class="portfolio-content">
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>Part of my criteria for finding a summer internship in 2021 was that it was in person. As a generally mechanical engineering focused person, I believe it is very important to work hands on. Sadly during this time Canada was going through a strenuous time with COVID-19, with vaccine shortages, strict lockdowns and the rumoured third wave. This made it really hard to find an in person internship. Luckily, since I was now a second year student, I got a few job offers in California. I ended up accepting an offer to work at Matician, in Palo Alto. Matician is building autonomous robots to help people, something that I align with perfectly.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>Flying to California during a pandemic was really interesting, planes were surprisingly packed yet airports were eerily empty. At my layover in Vancouver (YVR), I was on one of 4 non-domestic flights the entire day. The second day after I landed I already had my first vaccine shot, something that wouldn’t have happened in Canada for another few months. Despite all that I’ve been told about the American healthcare system, that was pretty sweet.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>Since I was a kid I have always wanted to travel to the valley, but my family has really only travelled on the east coast. Every week I tried to get out and try something new, and I documented that in this rather large blog post.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<b>Week 1</b>
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>A big portion of my first week was just getting moved in, figuring out where to get food and getting comfortable with my commute and my neighborhood. I rented a house with 5 other Matician interns, although it was only me and 2 other guys for the first month. In my first few days before work started, I went to Battery Yates, Fishermans Wharf, Stanford, Shoreline Park, and downtown Palo Alto. I also got vaccinated, got a bank account, applied for a Social Security Number and all the other fun intern errands. My first week at work went by super quickly, in my first couple of days I started catching up and getting familiarized with the team and the work that needed to be done. I was assigned my first project on my third day at work, one which would involve weeks of DOEs, prototypes, and brainstorming to finish.</p>

								<div class="text-box">
									<p>On the weekend after my first week I made it to San Francisco and met up with a friend from Waterloo I hadn’t seen in years. The city felt a lot like a fever dream, the roads slanting up at dizzying angles reminded me of that one scene from Inception. We walked around the mission district and Soma. The next day I biked through the Googleplex, Shoreline Park, and NASA Ames.</p>

								<div class="text-box">
									<b>Week 3</b>
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>I finally wrapped up my first project at the end of this week, and got assigned a really big open ended project going forward. I also had the opportunity to go surfing in Santa Cruz with a family friend who lives nearby on the weekend. I had gone before and was pretty comfortable with standing on the board, so it wasn’t too hard to pick it up again. It was crazy how many people were there, sitting on boards, waiting for the perfect wave. Sadly I didn’t get any pictures of me on the surfboard! After my second week at work I had gotten suggestions to go to Pinnacles National Park, and so the next day, my two roommates and I drove almost 2 hours south to the park. The hike was incredible; at one point going up super steep steps carved into a cliff face. Pinnacles is one of the few places on earth you can see condors, the largest flying bird in North America. We saw multiple, and near the top of the hike there was one perched not 20 feet away from us.</p>

									<b>Week 4</b>
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>At the end of May we had 4 days off, and some of the interns had joked around the idea of going sailing at Shoreline Park, but only 3 of us (including me) knew how to sail. The tricky part was that the skippers of the sail boats would have to pass a test. Luckily everyone passed, and we ended up having a great time. The day after I biked through foothills park, and saw Tesla’s HQ. On Saturday of that week I made it back up to San Francisco, this time to check out Haight Ashbury and Golden Gate Park. A lot of my family is named after the neighborhood so it was pretty special to me to be there. Sadly at the intersection of Clayton & Haight there wasn’t a sign with both street names. On Sunday I got the chance to see Muir Woods with some friends working at Tesla. It was shocking to walk through the massive trees, feeling like an ant. We hiked up a hill and made it up above the treeline, some odd 400 feet off the base of the forest.</p>

									<p>For some reason I got the genius idea of going biking up the Santa Cruz mountains with some coworkers. When they showed up with their super fancy bikes and aerodynamic clothing I knew I had screwed up. I showed up in khaki shorts and a t-shirt, and a heavy backpack - bad idea. By the time we had biked 10 miles to the base of the climb, I was already exhausted and had to stay behind. After resting for a bit I decided to go as far as I could up the hill, before turning around a racing back down. Apparently this road is pretty popular with road bikers, and sure thing there were hundreds all trying to make it to the top. The next day I could barely walk, and decided it would be best to relax.</p>

									<p>I really wanted to see more of the Pacific and the Bridge on the weekend, so I started at Sutro Baths, hiked through Lands End, and walked along Bakers Beach all the way to the Golden Gate. I still had time in the day and walked through Crissy Field Beach, saw the Palace of Fine Arts, climbed Lyons Street Steps and then got on a bike and made it to Coit Tower. The views this day were incredible, and I am still surprised by how far I made it on foot. I spent Sunday relaxing and doing some user testing of a prototype from work.</p>

									<p>I didn’t realize how close I was living to Mission Peak, and this week myself and two of my roommates were determined to climb it. We drove to the base and started climbing before quickly realizing we should’ve brought more water. But despite dehydration, we made it to the top relatively quickly and admired the view for a long time. We took the “less travelled path” on the way down, which was arguably more difficult than the way up. On Sunday all six of us living at the house had tickets booked to go to Alcatraz, so we dove to Pier 33 and took a ferry to the island. It was very spooky in a way that is hard to convey; knowing that some of the most dangerous people alive were locked up on an isolated island right next to a metropolis.</p>

									<p>Despite coming up on July 4th, I had a pretty laid back weed. I wrapped up my biggest project at work, and started working on a smaller one, that actually had an end in sight and wasn’t so open ended. I really took parkinson's law to heart on my previous project, being extremely thorough and careful with my decisions. On the Friday of the long weekend I went to downtown Mountain View, got lunch delivered by a Starship robot, and biked to Redwood Grove Nature Preserve. On Saturday I spent most of the day working on UW FSAE work, integrating a lot of my projects into the full vehicle model (my experience on UW FSAE can be seen on my projects page). On Sunday July 4th I went to San Francisco, checked out Mission Dolores park (which was packed), met up with some old friends, and watched the firework show at Aquatic Park.</p>

I got to know some coworkers better on a more personal level, and had lots of fun considering it was a company event! After the party a couple of us walked down to the Chase Center for a stand up comedy show. The next day I met up with a friend from Waterloo. We got lunch at the farmers market on California Avenue, and walked through Stanford University. After that I biked to Byxbee park and saw way too many birds, like seriously, how can that many birds live in the same park?</p>

I ended up needing more than the 50 hours I had already spent during the week, so I worked over the weekend too. I really wanted to make sure these parts got made before I left.</p>

On Sunday we headed to SF to stay at a hotel for the rest of her stay. We explored Dolores Park, Golden Gate Park, and its Japanese tea garden.

										Early the next day she flew home and I went back to work. I had received some early samples of some parts from our injection molding vendor that allowed me to do some material testing, and make some more educated design decisions. 
										On the weekend, myself and some coworkers planned to go camping in Stanislaus National Forest but sadly it was too smokey and wouldn’t have been enjoyable. Instead, we decided to do a long 16km hike up Mount Tamalpais. After the hike on our drive home, it just so happened that we were at the right time and place; the fog was rolling in over the ridges of the mountain right at sunset, which was incredibly beautiful.

Sadly, as soon as we stopped at our first sight seeing place, Fort Funston, her rental car got broken into and a good portion of my personal stuff got stolen. I learned my lesson the hard way! I had assumed that a conservancy park far from the city would be safe from break ins, but I guess not.

My favourite hike was to Stanley Glacier, where the main path stops about half way up to the actual glacier, but some small trails actually bring you up to the ice. The wedding in Canmore was amazing, tucked within mountains and with family I hadn’t seen in many years. The day after the wedding party we did an e-bike ride around Canmore, down the Bow river. After some more hiking I finally flew home, after being away from my family and friends for 4 months I am glad to be back.</p>

									<p>Personally, I didn’t really enjoy this book. I found it to be very dry and it talked a lot more about power structures and management than it did about how to actually build great products. I was hoping it would be more practical; explaining certain traits that iconic product designers and managers had that set them apart, and how to develop those traits. Although it did mention some iconic people, it was very brief and wasn’t the main focus of the book. I suppose I would recommend it to people that want to become product managers at big companies whilst still making an impact, but for everyone else, I don’t think it offered too much.</p>

									<p>This relatively short read was amazing, and I recommend it to anyone trying to find a good product market fit. The book, although published in 1960, manages to accurately predict the future through some basic logic. For example, one of the passages in the book predicts that oil companies should transition to electric energy in the future, as cars and other transportation methods will eventually switch to electricity. And this was in 1960!</p>

									<p>The book makes the argument that sometimes unconventional and illogical ideas are the best ones, and end up turning out the best. Some of the main things talked about in the book are the butterfly effect, changing your perspective when thinking about problems, and doing counterintuitive things on purpose. Another one of the main things that comes up often in the book is how big companies take little risk, because they have so much to lose. And that people in those companies don’t take big risks because it could mean failing and not being promoted; when really failure is something that should be acknowledged and learned from.</p>

									<h2 class="portfolio-title">UW Bridge Competition</h2>
									<p class="portfolio-subtitle">My design process in a class wide bridge building competition</p>
								</div>
							</div>
							<div class="portfolio-content">
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>As part of my Mechanics of Deformable Solids (MODS) course we had to design and build a truss bridge using things we learned in class. This project was done in groups of 3 and was worth a significant amount of our final mark. Most of the mark was based on how your bridge performed in a competition with the rest of the class, with the success metric being the weight it held divided by the weight of the bridge.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>I took the initiative to do the design portion of the project and started laying out requirements and goals for the project. The bridge had to span a 40cm gap, be no taller than 10cm, no wider than 8cm, and be loaded in the center of the bridge. We were limited to using laser-cut balsa wood and hardwood dowels for the pin joints.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="image-box">
									<img class="center-picture sixty-per" src="./assets/Bridge Outline.png">
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>To start the design I thought about some typical truss bridge shapes and layouts, but after some pondering I determined that minimizing the amount of members would be beneficial. This is because with more members, the chances of one having a weak point or a tolerance issue and being a “weak link” would be detrimental. From this I came up with two bridge designs, shown below.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="image-box">
									<img class="center-picture forty-per" src="./assets/Bridge Sim.png">
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>I ended up picking the 7 member truss since Euler's critical buckling load gets smaller with 1/L², and the 3 member truss has a much longer compression members. We knew we wanted to break last year's record of 598 g/g, so we aimed for a score of 700. From here, using an estimated bridge weight an approximate load can be calculated. I then used formulas to optimize the design, ensuring all failure modes would meet or exceed the load goal. I also used empirical testing with my team members on some test pieces we got cut. This was used to verify material properties and formula estimations. For example, to optimize the width of the members under compression I determined what fraction of the load they took, and used basic formulas to determine a thickness. We then tested those members under tension to see if they met the estimation, which they did. An analysis of the material properties can be seen below.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="image-box">
									<img class="center-picture forty-per" src="./assets/Material Data.png">
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>From here we got our bridge manufactured and tested it. We saw something that we didn’t predict happening; the bridge was twisting and shifting as we added more weight. It only made it to a score of 380, which was not up to our standards. We caught it on video and analyzed it to improve our next iteration (seen below).</p>
								</div>
								<div class="image-box">
									<img class="center-picture forty-per" src="./assets/Bridge Test 1.jpg">
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>To reduce the twisting we added cross members and hole supports to make the holes longer. After testing it, it successfully reached a score of 600 before twisting itself to pieces yet again. Our final iteration was the one we had to submit, no more testing, so we added even more twisting supports and handed it in hoping for the best.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="image-box">
									<img class="center-picture forty-per" src="./assets/Bridge Twist Supports.png">
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>Despite a really poor video quality, our bridge looked like it just kept taking more and more weight. It successfully broke the record and came 1st in the class. The final PV ratio was 649, breaking at 10kg and weighing a mere 15.4 grams. Despite not meeting the designed goal of 700, I am still proud of our team and the outcome of the competition.</p>

									<p>During the winter break I worked with 2 of my coworkers at Gastronomous to develop a prototype for an idea we had. The idea came after meeting with one of Canada’s largest restaurant brands, where they told us they have problems keeping a log of burger temperatures. We came up with a pair of “smart tongs” that could measure the internal temperature of anything you pick up with them. By doing this they can ensure that their grill is hot enough, the grill worker is cooking them thoroughly and most importantly they aren't serving undercooked food. We wanted to prototype this as soon as possible, so that we could present them to potential customers in the new year.</p>

To make a rapid prototype we used as many off the shelf parts as possible. We used a pair of tongs from a barbecue store, a pre-existing microcontroller, and avoided PCB manufacturing companies by making PCBs on my CNC router.</p>

									<p>For the electronics we decided to use an ESP8266 microcontroller to give the tongs wifi functionality; allowing them to display a live log on a webapp. We used an off the shelf burger thermocouple, paired with an ADC. For the interface with the user we used a simple button and an OLED display. I designed the power control circuitry while my coworker designed the control board.</p>

									<p>I designed the enclosure for the electronics, and tried to make it as sleek as possible (albeit the electronics are pretty large, and it ended up pretty bulky). I also designed the webapp using HTML and CSS running on the ESP8266 as a webserver. Finally I assembled the tongs, and mounted everything to them.</p>

									<p>Despite coronavirus pushing hackathons entirely online, some of my highschool friends wanted to compete in a hackathon to help gain some experience. We decided to apply to Hack Western and competed in it this past weekend, winning the Telus Mental Health Award. We started out knowing that we wanted to do something related to mental health in the pandemic setting, as it is now affecting more people than ever. We asked ourselves, what is one thing that was lost due to the pandemic and that a lot of people need, and that ended up being simply talking to someone. And thus the idea for VenTalk was born, an anonymous messaging platform for people to vent, or just casually talk.</p>

									<p>Even though I didn’t have any experience in making an app I still found a lot of ways to help. I used a Web API to compare sentences together and return the similarity as a percentage, and wrote an algorithm based on that to match up users based on the time they've been waiting and the similarity they have with another user. This allowed the app to connect people very quickly and (hopefully) they can talk about a common problem. I also shot and edited the video for our pitch which was a big reason why we won. Feel free to check out my Devpost for more information.</p>

								<div class="text-box">
									<p>As the final part of my CNC project, I needed a way to secure material to the table. A common way to do this is a lever that pulls down applying a force to the workpiece. To adjust heights, the lever is placed on a “step block” that resembles a staircase. I liked this solution but I had two problems with it. First, they are generally pretty short and can’t hold work that is in the middle of a wasteboard. Second, the ends of them are usually flat, which puts a lot of force on a sharp edge which could lead to denting and more scrap. My solution for this was very simple, an arm with a round “finger”, that could better distribute the force.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="image-box">
									<img class="center-picture sixty-per" src="./assets/Work Holding.png">
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>I really wasn’t sure what kind of forces I could achieve with this, and I wanted to ensure I could keep the workpiece solid, as it is a very common failure of CNC routers. To calculate what forces I needed, I used the coefficients of static friction between some of the common materials I cut, and whatever they were secured to. The smallest coefficient (between the MDF waste board and the aluminum table) represents what will slip first from cutting forces. Using a rough estimate of cutting forces and the friction equation, I was able to calculate that I need 366.7N of force on the end of the finger. To get this force, the bolt would have to exert 620.6N of force, bending the finger.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="image-box">
									<img class="center-picture sixty-per" src="./assets/Work Holding Math.png">
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>To ensure that the finger wouldn’t bend and potentially break I ran an FEA simulation. Since I was printing the parts solid I assumed that the simulation would be similar to real life. In the first simulation I ran, the maximum displacement was around 2.10mm, then I made the part taller to increase its area moment of inertia. In the second simulation I ran (below, left) the displacement dropped down to 1.04mm, and finally, I made the part a bit wider and achieved a maximum displacement of 0.0873mm (below right).</p>

								<div class="text-box">
									<p>All in all, I was very happy with the results, and I hope when I test them out they will work reliably. The worst thing I would want is to waste a work in progress part because it slipped out of work holding.</p>

									<p>Recently my roommates got into YoYoing, something that I didn’t realize there was still a following for. The most interesting part to me was the extremely specialty bearings (costing up to $40) that can spin under their own mass moment of inertia. When the large “butterfly” shaped flywheel is added, a good yoyo can freespin for more than 10 minutes. This, of course, interested me, and in my free time after studying I decided to start designing a yoyo bearing.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="image-box">
									<img class="center-picture sixty-per" src="./assets/Bearings.png">
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>I did some basic research on bearing design, types of races, arches and filling methods. I knew I would have to play around with clearances a lot, to make a free-spinning bearing the clearances need to be pretty loose. I started with a large 2 point contact bearing with a channel to fill the balls (1), then I tried slowly increasing the preload in iterations (2) and (3). Once I found the right clearance to use, I shrunk the design (4) and experimented with a gothic arch style (5). The 4 point contact style of the gothic arch added too much static friction, so I went back to the 2 point contact in iteration (6).</p>

									<p>Overall I learned about how bearings are designed, and the different styles used to construct them and make them function. Even though 3D printed plastic is not ideal for bearing races, it did help me learn a lot and experiment quickly. At the end of this, I used bearing (6) to make a yoyo (pictured below), and it free spun for around a minute!</p>

									<p>When I was in elementary school, I was teaching myself basic electronics principles, components and circuits. Going into middle school I started trying to apply this knowledge, trying to make a go-cart, small “robots” and other similar things. When I got into microcontrollers in grade 6, my passion for tinkering really took off, because now I could program my projects and add so much more value to them. In grade 7 after some Arduino experience, I built my first decent project, a pair of smart glasses with a TFT screen and voice control (pictured below).</p>

With this media attention, it caught the eyes of the Glass division at Google, who sent me a gift package in the mail which made 13 year old me really happy.</p>

									<p>The next year I wanted to try making one of my dream projects come to life, I wanted to make a full-body exoskeleton capable of giving me extra strength and speed. Maybe that was too much of an ambitious goal for a 15-year-old... Despite the massive challenge this would pose, I went to work designing, 3D printing and prototyping parts for it. Realizing that this would end up costing a lot of money, I launched the project on Kickstarter, offering some rewards for people that helped out. The project was funded successfully, allowing me to buy some of the expensive equipment and components necessary.</p>

									<p>One of the most interesting things I developed for the project was a super light, powerful and compliant actuator. This “air muscle” was constructed with a soft, flexible tube that when pressurized would expand, pulling a braided sleeve and contracting (pictured below). Another thing I tried to do was to make the exoskeleton take all the weight off of the legs, which didn’t end up working well, but the principles were there. This was done with over-center locking mechanisms, extending from the “spine” to the knees, allowing a load on the back to be transferred directly to the feet (pictured below).</p>

									<p>After applying for jobs in my 1B school term, in the summer of 2020, I realized that having an easy to access portfolio could really help me. Before this website, I would just hope that employers and recruiters would see the little “see portfolio” note on my resume. But now it's easy to provide a link to my website where people can see my experience, projects and well, this blog.</p>

									<p>At the end of the term, I was watching some videos on HTML and CSS to try and learn some basic skills. Once I got the basics down, I drafted the look of this website in Figma and translated that into HTML and CSS. The hardest part for me was writing all the content, consolidating all my projects, and making sure they all had enough pictures and renders.</p>
