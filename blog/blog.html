									<p>Recently my roommates got into YoYoing, something that I didn’t realize there was still a following for. The most interesting part to me was the extremely specialty bearings (costing up to $40) that can spin under their own mass moment of inertia. When the large “butterfly” shaped flywheel is added, a good yoyo can freespin for more than 10 minutes. This, of course, interested me, and in my free time after studying I decided to start designing a yoyo bearing.</p>

								<div class="image-box">

								<div class="text-box">
									<p>I did some basic research on bearing design, types of races, arches and filling methods. I knew I would have to play around with clearances a lot, to make a free-spinning bearing the clearances need to be pretty loose. I started with a large 2 point contact bearing with a channel to fill the balls (1), then I tried slowly increasing the preload in iterations (2) and (3). Once I found the right clearance to use, I shrunk the design (4) and experimented with a gothic arch style (5). The 4 point contact style of the gothic arch added too much static friction, so I went back to the 2 point contact in iteration (6).</p>

									<p>Overall I learned about how bearings are designed, and the different styles used to construct them and make them function. Even though 3D printed plastic is not ideal for bearing races, it did help me learn a lot and experiment quickly. At the end of this, I used bearing (6) to make a yoyo (pictured below), and it free spun for around a minute!</p>

									<p>When I was in elementary school, I was teaching myself basic electronics principles, components and circuits. One of my show and tell assignments I actually brought an astable multivibrator circuit. Going into middle school I started trying to apply this knowledge, trying to make a go-cart, small “robots” and other similar things. When I got into microcontrollers in grade 6, it really took off my passion for tinkering, because now I could program my projects and add so much more value to them. In grade 7 after some Arduino experience, I built my first decent project, a pair of smart glasses with a TFT screen and voice control (pictured below). Now I never said I was good at making things look professional, but it still impressed people, making it to reporters at Makezine, Time, and the Discovery channel. With this media attention, it caught the eyes of the Glass division at Google, who sent me a gift package in the mail which made 13 year old me really happy.</p>

									<p>The next year I wanted to try making one of my dream projects come to life, I wanted to make a full-body exoskeleton capable of giving me extra strength and speed. Maybe that was too much of an ambitious goal for a 15-year-old... Despite the massive challenge this would pose, I went to work designing, 3D printing and prototyping parts for it. Realizing that this would end up costing a lot of money, I launched the product on Kickstarter, offering some rewards for people that helped fund my project. The project was funded successfully, allowing me to buy some of the expensive equipment and components.</p>

									<p>I learned so much doing this project and some really valuable lessons that helped me become the person I am today. I realize, looking back, that it was extremely sketchy, and so many things were done wrong. But I am glad it went that way because I learned so much.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>One of the most interesting things I developed for the project was a super light, powerful and compliant actuator. This “air muscle” was constructed with a soft, flexible tube that when pressurized would expand, pulling a braided sleeve and contracting (pictured below). Another thing I tried to do was to make the exoskeleton take all the weight off of the legs, which didn’t end up working well, but the principles were there. This was done with over-center locking mechanisms, extending from the “spine” to the knees, allowing a load on the back to be transferred directly to the feet (pictured below).</p>

									<p>After applying for jobs in my 1B school term, in the summer of 2020, I realized that having an easy to access portfolio could really help me. Before this website, I would just hope that employers and recruiters would see the little “see portfolio” note on my resume. But now it's easy to provide a link to my website where people can see my experience, projects and well, this blog.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="text-box">
									<p>At the end of the term, I was watching some videos on HTML and CSS to try and learn some basic skills. Once I got the basics down, I drafted the look of this website in Figma and translated that into HTML and CSS. The hardest part for me was writing all the content, consolidating all my projects, and making sure they all had enough pictures and renders.</p>

									<p>I learned a lot of skills from this project, and maybe one day I will improve the website since it is still in its first draft. I hope to keep it updated with blog posts, job experience and any new projects I do.</p>
